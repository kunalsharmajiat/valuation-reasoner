🏢 **ValuCompany — Transparent Valuation Reasoning System**

**Project Name: Valuation Reasoner
Developed for: ValuCompany – Financial Transparency Initiative (Hiring Assessment 5)
Author: Kunal Sharma**

📘 **Overview**

The Valuation Reasoner was built to **demonstrate financial transparency and analytical reasoning for ValuCompany’s** assessment.
It simulates how a **financial analyst** explains **every step** of a **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)** and **Multiples-based valuation** — **combining numbers** and **narrative clarity**.
This project showcases **both technical skills (Python, finance)** and **communication ability**, **two key traits** in **valuation** and **data analysis roles**.

The system simulates a reasoning engine capable of walking through the valuation process step by step — combining quantitative finance with narrative clarity.

🧮 **What It Does**

The Valuation Reasoner script performs both:

Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation — Projects revenue, computes free cash flows, discounts them using WACC, and calculates terminal value via the Gordon Growth Model.

Multiples-Based Valuation — Uses an exit EV/EBITDA multiple to estimate enterprise value and provides a reconciliation between the two valuation approaches.

It also generates a sensitivity analysis grid to show how changes in discount rate and terminal growth affect valuation results.

**⚙️ Features Summary**

Performs DCF Valuation with step-by-step explanations

Implements a Multiples (EV/EBITDA) method for cross-checking results

Provides automated sensitivity analysis for discount rate and growth

Generates both numeric results (JSON/CSV) and readable narrative reports (TXT)

100% transparent — every calculation is explained

Easy to extend for real company data
🧠 **How It Works**

The script accepts financial assumptions (revenue, margins, growth, WACC, etc.) as inputs, then:

Projects revenues and cash flows over the forecast period.

Discounts those cash flows to present value using the DCF model.

Calculates terminal value using the Gordon Growth model.

Computes an alternative valuation using the EV/EBITDA multiple approach.

Produces a clear, written explanation of each computation and its rationale.

📂 **Output Files**

Running the script generates the following files automatically:

valuation_output_dcf.json — Detailed numeric DCF results

valuation_output_multiples.json — Numeric output for multiples-based valuation

valuation_explanation_dcf.txt — Full DCF narrative explanation

valuation_explanation_multiples.txt — Multiples method explanation

sensitivity_grid.csv — Valuation grid showing effects of discount and terminal growth

README_Valuation_Reasoner.txt — Summary documentation

🧾 Example Use Case

ValuCompany’s analysts can use this reasoning engine to:

Demonstrate valuation transparency to investors and regulators

Audit how assumptions affect enterprise value

Provide clients with both numeric and narrative valuation reports

🛠️  **Technologies Used**
